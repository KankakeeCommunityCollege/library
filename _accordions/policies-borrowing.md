Materials are available to current faculty, students and staff, residents of KCC District 520 (with a valid ID card) and affiliated borrowers. Patrons should never allow someone else to use their ID card. The owner of the ID card is responsible for all materials borrowed against it.

### Check-out Periods
{: .typography__h3 }

Most books can be checked out for four weeks to students, staff and non-students; and for 16 weeks to faculty, unless otherwise noted. Generally all materials other than books and CDs are for use in the library only. Materials should be returned to the circulation desk during library hours. 
When the library is closed, return materials in the book drop located next to the library entrance. 

### Renewing Materials
{: .typography__h3 }

Books are permitted one renewal, providing the item has not been recalled for use by another patron. Patrons may renew materials by bringing the item(s) to the circulation desk or by renewing in  [KCC's Primo catalog](https://i-share-kcc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01CARLI_KCC:CARLI_KCC){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }. 

### Fines and Fees
{: .typography__h3 }

Miner Memorial Library is a fine-free library.  This means that there is no daily charge for overdue items, with the exception of some high-demand equipment and technology, such as laptops.

Overdue notices will be sent for late materials. If a patron does not return items in a timely manner, he or she will be billed $75 for the replacement cost of the book. If items are damaged when returned, the patron will be billed for repairs or replacement. Borrowing privileges will be suspended for patrons who have been billed until the book is returned or the fee is paid.

Suspended privileges will prevent you from borrowing or requesting materials from the library as well as any other I-Share member library. You may also be prevented from registering for classes, obtaining grades or transcripts, and/or graduating from KCC.
