The KCC tutoring staff consists of current and former KCC students, community professionals and adjunct faculty members. Each tutor is required to complete CRLA Regular/Level 1 Training by the end of the semester in which he/she is hired. Tutors are highly proficient and in some cases have mastered the subject area they tutor.
