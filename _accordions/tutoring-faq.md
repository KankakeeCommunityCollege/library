**What are the benefits of tutoring?**

**Who receives tutoring?**
{: .mb-1 }

Everyone! Some of the students who come to the tutor labs are already doing well in their classes and want to do better or get ahead. It is crucial to take advantage of tutoring services before you fall too far behind. Tutoring will not help you if you sign up for a last-minute session before the big test!

**What happens during a tutoring session?**
{: .mb-1 }

Your tutor will ask you what you need and how you have approached the subject so far. He or she will involve you in a discussion of the course material. Tutors are trained to help you find your own correct answers. They assist you with basic reading/writing/math skills necessary for success in your college courses. Your tutor will also help you with note-taking and test-taking skills, and tips on how to study your particular subject.

**Do I need an appointment or an instructor referral to see a tutor?**
{: .mb-1 }

No. Tutoring is available on a walk-in and first come, first served basis during open lab hours. However, an instructor may advise you to visit the tutoring center if he/she feels that you can benefit from the services offered.  Online tutoring sessions do require an appointment, but appointments do not need to be made in advance; you can sign up for the next available time slot.
