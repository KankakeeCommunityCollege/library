KCC students, faculty and staff members with current, valid KCC ID cards are eligible to borrow items from I-Share, a combined catalog of the items of over 80 academic libraries in the state of Illinois. The library user should search for the item in the [KCC Primo Catalog](https://i-share-kcc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01CARLI_KCC:CARLI_KCC){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } and use the 'Request' option, which automatically routes the request to library staff.

If an item is unavailable from KCC or from any of the I-Share libraries, current KCC students, faculty and staff may submit an interlibrary loan request. Please check [KCC's Primo Catalog](https://i-share-kcc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01CARLI_KCC:CARLI_KCC){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } before placing requests.

### Fees and Restrictions
{: .typography__h3 }

Requests take 4 to 10 days to be filled, but may take longer for uncommon items. Patrons are limited to five item requests and five article requests at a time.  Every effort is made to obtain materials free of charge. If obtaining the item would incur a service fee (usually $10 to $20) please indicate in your request the amount you would be willing to pay. Any fees associated with lost and/or damaged books and overdue or replacement fines will be passed directly to the borrowing patron.

Books are usually available for loan from other libraries. Certain types of materials may not be available such as reference materials, rare and special collections, entire volumes/issues of periodicals, A/V materials, and fiction items published less than four months ago.

### Book Requests
{: .typography__h3 }

Patrons should first search [WorldCat](http://www.firstsearch.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } (contact the library for the password) and look for an 'ILL' option to request the item. This will automatically route the request to library staff. If the option is unavailable, send an email to [tconner@kcc.edu](mailto:tconner@kcc.edu), including the exact book title and author; the year of publication and ISBN number; your first and last name; your KCC ID barcode number; and a telephone number or email address. Telephone requests are not accepted.

### Article Requests
{: .typography__h3 }

Patrons should first search KCC's [online databases](http://kcc.libguides.com/az.php){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } to ensure that access is not already available. If the article is unavailable, please submit a request using the following form.

 <div class="mb-4" id="form_button_8d49f10dcb7f170c0936a1866e70010a"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://kcc.libwizard.com/embed_button.php?id=8d49f10dcb7f170c0936a1866e70010a&noheader=0&type=button&open-button-text=Request%20an%20Article&open-button-color=%23003768&text-color=%23ffffff" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

### Pick-up and Return
{: .typography__h3 }

Patrons will be notified by email or phone when the item has arrived. Materials are available for pick up at the circulation desk with a valid KCC ID card. Unclaimed books will be returned to the lending library two weeks after date of receipt. Unclaimed photocopies will be discarded after 30 days. 

Materials are generally loaned for four weeks, but some libraries have shorter loan periods. As a borrower, you are subject to the lending library's fines and policies on overdue materials. Failure to comply may result in suspension of borrowing privileges. 

Materials may be returned to the circulation desk or the library book drop.

### Renewals
{: .typography__h3 }

Requests for renewal may be brought to the circulation desk, or emailed to [bcastillo@kcc.edu](mailto:bcastillo@kcc.edu) at least three days before the due date. The lending library will be contacted to request a renewal.
