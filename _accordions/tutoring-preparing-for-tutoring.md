Please take the following steps to maximize the benefits of tutoring:
{: .mb-1 }

- **Attend all class meetings**. Your tutor cannot help if you are not familiar with the material your instructor is covering.
- **Know class assignments and teacher instructions**. Your tutor will be better able to assist and time will not be wasted determining what you should work on if you know the assignment.
- **Complete assignments and review before tutoring sessions**. This includes reading the text, reviewing class notes and preparing questions for your tutor.
- **Bring appropriate materials** (book, paper, handouts, calculator, etc.). Make sure you have everything you will need to cover the material you are seeking help with.

Preparing for tutoring sessions will help you realize the greatest benefits of the service. It will also help you become a better student.
