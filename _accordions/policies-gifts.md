The Miner Memorial Library will accept gifts without obligation to the donor. Gifts are subject to the same criteria as other acquisitions, including condition of the item, as well as its currency and relevance to the library collection and KCC curriculum.

The donor must be willing to accept the judgment of the library director to utilize the gift as appropriate.
