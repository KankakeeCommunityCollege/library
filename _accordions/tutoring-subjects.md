Tutoring is available for most core courses. We will make every effort to accommodate your needs but cannot guarantee we will be able to find a tutor for you. Additionally, you can receive help with course-related Canvas questions or questions about other common technology such as MS Office or MyLabs products. We also offer tips for time management, studying, and test-taking strategies.

All students--in all course subjects--are welcome to visit for assistance with writing assignments at any point in the process! Tutors provide assistance with:
