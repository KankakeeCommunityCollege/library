KCC employees and students must show their current, valid KCC ID card. The TRIO students' ID card must have a current TRIO sticker. A copy of the equipment user agreement must be completed for each check out. The checkout period is one week, with one renewal permitted, provided there is no one on the waiting list.

### Waiting List

TRIO students and KCC employees and students may put their name on a waiting list to be notified when a laptop, mini-recorder or calculator is available. When staff or students are called, the equipment will be held in reserve for them for 24 hours.

### Equipment Inspection

The circulation staff, in the presence of the patron, will inspect all components when the laptop, mini-recorder or calculator is checked out and checked in. The student or staff member must personally return the items to the circulation desk. Students' failure to return equipment will result in a suspension of their KCC student account, prohibiting them from receiving grades or transcripts and from registering for classes. 

### Fines

The overdue fine for equipment is $10 per day. The student will be charged no less than $2,000 for the loss or theft of a laptop. Replacement or repair cost varies for each component. The replacement cost for a mini-recorder will be no less than $50 and a calculator no less than $80, plus the accrued fines.

### Restrictions

Only the components checked out with a laptop may be used with that computer; other hardware is not allowed. Only the software pre-installed by KCC may be used on each computer; other software is not allowed. 

Students must save their files or documents to their own disks or a flash drive. Disks and flash drives are not provided by the library, but can be purchased in the college bookstore. Files saved onto the laptop's hard drive may be removed after the computer is checked in.
