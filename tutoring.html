          <p>As a KCC student, you have access to free tutoring services to assist you as you pursue your degree. Our tutor program is certified by the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA).</p>

          <p>Tutoring aims to supplement what is done in the classroom and during study time, not substitute for it. Our qualified staff is trained to assist you in an environment conducive to learning for short-term and long-term academic and personal accomplishment.</p>

          <p>With that in mind, please share your feedback on the things we are doing well and/or how tutoring services can be more effective. We appreciate your time and value your input.
